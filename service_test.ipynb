These so-called next generation machines will be faster than current consoles, and capable of displaying much higher-quality visuals. For gamers, this should make for better, more immersive games. In a pre-recorded video slot during Microsofts keynote address at the Game Developers Conference, held last week in San Francisco, famed director James Cameron revealed he is making a game in tandem with his next film - believed to be Battle Angel Alita. The games visual quality would be like a lucid dream, said Mr Cameron. But numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists, and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop. The first new console, Microsofts Xbox 2, is not expected to reach the shops until the end of 2005. Games typically take at least 18 months to create, however, so developers are grappling with the hardware today.\\n\\nAccording to Robert Walsh, head of Brisbane-based game developer Krome Studios, next generation games will cost between $10-25m to make, with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title. Such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio, said Mr Walsh. If youre a start-up, I doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for $10m, however good you are, he said. Mr Walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the Sony PSP and the Nintendo DS, since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games.\\n\\nOne developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is Will Wright, the creator of the best-selling The Sims games. The founder of Californias Maxis studio surprised the conference with a world exclusive preview of his next game, Spore. Spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures. Starting with an amoeba-sized organism, the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs, jaws and other body parts evolve.\\n\\nEventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities, trading and fighting, and even building space ships. Advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other Spore players. These worlds will be automatically swapped across the Internet. Mr Wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game. I dont want to put the player in the role of Luke Skywalker or Frodo Baggins - I want them to be George Lucas or Dr Seuss, explained Mr Wright. Few games have hinted at the scope of Spore, but Mr Wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers. Instead of employing lots of artists to create 3D models of the digital creatures, Spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers. The thing I am coming away with [from the conference] is that next generation content is going to be really expensive, and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market, said Mr Wright. Id like to offer an alternative to that.\\n\\nNew development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games, and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference.\\n\\nOxford-based Natural Motion launched Endorphin v2.0, which enables artists to direct a 3D virtual actor. The actor is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics. Endorphin simulates how the actor falls down stairs, for instance, or crumples up after a gunshot. Artists can blend together these visual sequences, and include the results in their games. The process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand, and so lessens the need for larger art teams. Another British company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is Manchester start-up Genemation. Its latest tool, GenCrowd, enables artists to create unique, photo-realistic human faces for games involving lots of people. GenCrowd works by blending together elements of an in-built supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities. The software can create up to 2,000 new heads an hour.\\n\\nOne area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games. Even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago, so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices.\\n\\nThe Game Developers Conference included a special two-day summit dedicated to creating mobile games. A niche attraction for a few dozen conference attendees when it began five years ago, GDCs Mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates. Mobile games are a fast-growing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound, and are thus more suitable for playing games. Furthermore, the adoption of mobile phones continues to spread across the world. Its predicted that by 2006 two billion people will own a mobile phone. The growing importance of mobile gaming was reflected by a keynote given by John Batter, general manager at EA Mobile. EA Mobile is a division of Electronic Arts, the biggest games publisher. Until recently Electronic Arts had been dismissive of games for phones. The last time you checked, EA wasnt in this business, Mr Batter admitted. But he said EA now planned on dominating the market by releasing mobile versions of its most popular franchises. EA plans to release up to 20 mobile games over the next 12 months. The first will be a version of its Need for Speed racing game, created by EA Mobiles 30-person development team. Mr Batter predicted that by 2006, mobile phones would be capable of running games of comparable quality to those on Sonys upcoming PSP handheld console.\\n\\nOwain Bennallack is the editor of Develop magazine.\\n', 'topic': 'tech'}, {'id': 2201, 'text': 'More movies head to Sonys PSP\\n\\nMovies Open Water and Saw are among those to be made available for Sonys PSP games console.\\n\\nFilm studio Lions Gate entertainment has announced an initial list of 12 movies that will be on the UMD format used by the handheld. The typical buyer of the machine [is] the core demographic to whom our films generally appeal, said Steve Beeks, president of Lions Gate. Already available in Japan, the PSP is released in the US on 24 March. Spider-Man 2 on UMD will be given to the first million customers in the US.\\n\\nThe Punisher and House of the Dead along with older titles such as Total Recall and Rambo: First Blood, will be in the UMD format, with disks costing between $20 (£10.40) to $30 (£15.60) for new titles and $10 (£5.20) to $20 for older films.\\n\\nWhen we first saw the machine and started talking to Sony, we immediately decided it was going to be a winner, both from the gaming perspective and from the perspective of people watching movies on the go, Mr Beeks said. The disks, which are smaller than DVDs, only work in Sonys PSP and can hold up to 1.8GB of data. We actually believe people who buy the UMD would not have bought it on DVD, he said. There are people who will want UMD because of the portability. Maybe theyre already taking the games with them out of the house, and theyre bigger gamers than they are movie watchers. Four movies have already been announced for PSP. They are: XXX, Hellboy, Resident Evil: Apocalypse and Once Upon a Time in Mexico.\\n', 'topic': 'tech'}, {'id': 2183, 'text': 'Solutions to net security fears\\n\\nFake bank e-mails, or phishing, and stories about ID theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce, say e-business experts.\\n\\nTrust in online security is falling as a result. Almost 70% of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people. The survey of more than 1,000 people reported that 43% were not willing to hand over personal information online. It is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net. More people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats, said security firm RSA, which carried out the poll. An estimated 12 million Britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs. Security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e-commerce and e-banking are being taken seriously - by banks in particular.\\n\\nI dont think the threat is overplayed, Barry Beal, global security manager for Capgemini, told the BBC News website. He added: The challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability. Ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too, as well as the individual, and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud, he said. Card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves. If we do that, they will indemnify us, he said. Many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though. One of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individuals identity. Several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords, which are easily compromised and easy to forget. Last year, a street survey found that more than 70% of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate.\\n\\nOn average, people have to remember four different passwords. Some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts. Those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer. In a separate survey by RSA, 80% said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems. For many, the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions, or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard.\\n\\nActivcard is just one of the many companies, like RSA Security, which has been trying to come up with just that. RSA has a deal with internet provider AOL that lets people pay monthly for a one-time passcode generation service. Users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for 60 seconds. Many companies use a token-based method already for employees to access networks securely already. Activcards method is more complex. It is currently trailing its one-time passcode generation technology with UK banks. Steve Ash, from Activcard, told the BBC News website there are two parts to the process of identification. The most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online.\\n\\nThe end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both. The method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time. This can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before it changes. It combines that with usual usernames and passwords, as well as other security questions. You take the card, put it in the reader, enter your pin number, and a code is given. If you wanted then to transfer funds, for instance, you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction. The clever bit happens back at the banks secure servers. The code is validated by the banks systems, matching the information they expect with the customers unique key. Each individual gets a key which is unique to them. It is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack, said Mr Ash. It means that in a typical security attack, explains Mr Ash, even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites, they need the passcode. By the time they go back [to use the information], the code has expired, so they cant prove who they are, according to Mr Ash. In the next few years, Mr Ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use. PCs will have readers built into them, the cost of readers will be very cheap, and more people will have the cards. The gadgets we carry around, like personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobiles, could also have integrated card reader technology in them. The PDA or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around, he said.\\n', 'topic': 'tech'}, {'id': 2182, 'text': 'Sony PSP console hits US in March\\n\\nUS gamers will be able to buy Sonys PlayStation Portable from 24 March, but there is no news of a Europe debut.\\n\\nThe handheld console will go on sale for $250 (£132) and the first million sold will come with Spider-Man 2 on UMD, the disc format for the machine. Sony has billed the machine as the Walkman of the 21st Century and has sold more than 800,000 units in Japan. The console (12cm by 7.4cm) will play games, movies and music and also offers support for wireless gaming. Sony is entering a market which has been dominated by Nintendo for many years.\\n\\nIt launched its DS handheld in Japan and the US last year and has sold 2.8 million units. Sony has said it wanted to launch the PSP in Europe at roughly the same time as the US, but gamers will now fear that the launch has been put back. Nintendo has said it will release the DS in Europe from 11 March. It has gaming at its core, but its not a gaming device. Its an entertainment device, said Kaz Hirai, president of Sony Computer Entertainment America.\\n', 'topic': 'tech'}, {'id': 2181, 'text': 'China blocks Google news site\\n\\nChina has been accused of blocking access to Google News by the media watchdog, Reporters Without Borders.\\n\\nThe Paris-based pressure group said the English-language news site had been unavailable for the past 10 days. It said the aim was to force people to use a Chinese edition of the site which, according to the watchdog, does not include critical reports. Google told the BBC News website it was aware of the problems and was investigating the causes.\\n\\nChina is believed to extend greater censorship over the net than any other country in the world.\\n\\nA net police force monitors websites and e-mails, and controls on gateways connecting the country to the global internet are designed to prevent access to critical information. Popular Chinese portals such as Sina.com and Sohu.com maintain a close eye on content and delete politically sensitive comments. And all 110,000 net cafes in the country have to use software to control access to websites considered harmful or subversive.\\n\\nChina is censoring Google News to force internet users to use the Chinese version of the site which has been purged of the most critical news reports, said the group in a statement. By agreeing to launch a news service that excludes publications disliked by the government, Google has let itself be used by Beijing, it said. For its part, the search giant said it was looking into the issue. It appears that many users in China are having difficulty accessing Google News sites in China and we are working to understand and resolve the issue, said a Google spokesperson. Google News gathers information from some 4,500 news sources. Headlines are selected for display entirely by a computer algorithm, with no human editorial intervention. It offers 15 editions of the service, including one tailored for China and one for Hong Kong. Google launched a version in simplified Chinese in September. The site does not filter news results to remove politically sensitive information. But Google does not link to news sources which are inaccessible from within China as this would result in broken links.\\n', 'topic': 'tech'}]\n"
